Javascript UI Templates
=======================

Collection general use browser widget/gadget templates. Very generic and simplistic, meant only as a starting point.
Currently they all depend on jQuery (>= 1.6.2).  If you use another (or no) library and adapt any of these, please do fork this project and add them.
Where necessary, a comment at the bottom of the file will container suggessted CSS rules to be used.

While these rely on jQuery, they are not jQuery plugins and do not use a jQuery plugin pattern.
jQuery plugins are meant for 'plug & go' usage - these are meant to be adapted for use in each individual project.
Look at gadget_pattern.js for a commented version of the pattern used in each template.
